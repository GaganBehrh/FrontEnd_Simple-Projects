        The four national languages of Switzerland are <b>German, French, Italian and Romansh</b>. German, French and Italian maintain equal status as official languages at the national level within the Federal Administration of the Swiss Confederation, while Romansh is used in dealings with people who speak it.In 2017, 62.6% of the population of Switzerland were native speakers of German (58.5% spoke Swiss German and 11.1% Standard German at home); 22.9% French (mostly Swiss French, but including some Franco-Proven√ßal dialects); 8.2% Italian (mostly Swiss Italian, but including Lombard dialects); and 0.5% Romansh.[6] The German region (Deutschschweiz) is roughly in the east, north and centre; the French part (la Romandie) in the west and the Italian area (Svizzera italiana) in the south. There remains a small Romansh-speaking native population in Grisons in the east. The cantons of Fribourg, Bern and Valais are officially bilingual; Grisons is officially trilingual.
